# Disclosures

WageMap is a static, client-only visualization. No application data is sent to a backend that we control; all computations run in the browser. The datasets below ship with the repository so the map works offline once assets are loaded.

## Datasets

## Privacy notes

- The app does not log or persist user-entered salaries or selections; everything stays in the browser.
- Basemap tile requests go directly from the browser to Mapbox and are subject to Mapbox telemetry and usage policies.
- Sharing uses the native share sheet (if available) or copies the current URL to the clipboard; no additional tracking is added.

## Limitations and disclaimers

- Wage and lottery data are provided for informational/visualization purposes only and should not be treated as legal advice or an official prevailing wage determination.
- Static datasets may become outdated; rebuild data when OFLC publishes new releases or when USCIS announces updated H-1B selection rates.
- County name normalization may introduce occasional mismatches for uncommon naming variants (e.g., consolidated city-counties); please verify edge cases against the source data when in doubt.
